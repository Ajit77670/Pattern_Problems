----------------PATTERN QUESTION CONCEPT----------------

>> First Point : Always seek first how many lines are there in the given pattern. Lines means the each individual line 
   consist of pattern. 
   *
   **
   ***
   ****
   *****
   For ex: the above pattern have no. of lines, n=5.

>> Second Point : The outer for loop is representing the row no. and the row no. will runs based on the no. of lines
      in the pattern i.e no. of lines (n) = no. of rows = no.of times outer loop will run.

>> Third Point : We need to establish the relation between row and col in order to print the pattern, most important point.

>> Fourth Point : When one row is printed , we need to add a newline. i.e System.out.println();
